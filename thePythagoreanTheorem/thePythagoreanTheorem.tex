\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
In this activity we will see some proofs of the most famous theorem of
  all.

\maketitle



\begin{question}
Remind us, what is the most famous theorem of all and what exactly
does it assert?
\end{question}




\subsection*{Proofs by picture}



\begin{question}
Check out:
\begin{image}
\includegraphics{pbppyth1.pdf}
\end{image}
How does the picture above ``prove'' the Pythagorean Theorem?
\end{question}


\begin{question}
Explain how the following picture ``proves'' the Pythagorean Theorem.
\begin{image}

\end{image}
\end{question}


\begin{question}
Check out this tessellation involving $2$ squares:
\begin{image}
\includegraphics{pbppyth2.pdf}
\end{image}
How does the picture above ``prove'' the Pythagorean Theorem?
\end{question}





\subsection*{Euclid's proof}


\begin{question} 
What would one need to prove about the following diagram to prove the
Pythagorean Theorem?
\begin{image}
\includegraphics{PythEuclid.pdf}
\end{image}
\end{question}

Let's see if we can do this!


\begin{question}
Draw a line perpendicular to $\bar{AB}$ that passes though both $C$
and $\bar{A'' B''}$. Call the intersection between this line and
$\bar{AB}$, point $E$; call the intersection point between this line
and $\bar{A''B''}$, point $E'$. Explain why $\tri ACA''$ has half the
area of rectangle $AEE'A''$.
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Explain why $\tri ABA'$ has half the area of square $ACC'A'$.
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Explain why $\tri ACA''$ is congruent to $\tri ABA'$. 
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Explain why area of square $ACC'A'$ is equal to the area of rectangle
$AEE'A''$.
\end{question}


\begin{question}
Use similar ideas to complete a proof the Pythagorean Theorem.
\end{question}


\subsection*{The converse}

\begin{question} What is the converse to the Pythagorean Theorem? Is it true? How do you prove it?
\end{question}
